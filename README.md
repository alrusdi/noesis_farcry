noesis_farcry
=============

Plugin for importing FarCry 3/2 models into [Noesis](http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads) viewer


Installation
=============

Just put fmt_farcry_xbg.py into plugins/python directory  

Limitations
=============

Current version loads only one (most detailed) LOD with normals and UVs  


Credits
=============

Work on reverse engineering the xbg file format is done by Chipicao  
I'm just ported his respective [3d studio max script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095) into python and added support for Noesis
